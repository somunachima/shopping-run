# Shopping List
This is a simple webapp which people can use to keep track of a shopping list.

## Key Features:
- Add an item to the shopping list
- View the whole shopping list
- Delete an individual item from the shopping list
- Delete the entire shopping list with a single button click (without needing to delete each individual item one by one)
- Login with a Google account
- Shopping list persists between logins

## Additional Features:
- Search items on the shopping list
- Filter shopping list based on categories
- Drag and drop items to sort shoppping list
- Save or unsave an individual item on the list
- View only saved items on a seperate page
- Unsave all items on the saved list
- Sign up to make a new account without a Google Account

## Future Plans
Besides the issues below, there are few more features I want to build:
- [ ] Update schema so that users has many lists which has many items which has many bookmarks, and users has many bookmarks
- [x] Allow users to add their own profile photo on sign up if they are not using a Google Account
- [ ] Add a description which toggles down when you click an item card
- [x] Add categories to the item's model so that the list can be filtered based on item type (e.g. Groceries, Clothes, Toiletries, Electronics etc)
- [ ] Add a web scraper so that people can search and add items from the internet

### Known Issues
- Get the turbo alert to pop up before deleting all items to confirm if the user is sure they want to delete all items
- Prevent the deletion of the saved list when deleting items from the shopping list
- Prevent redirection to shopping list page when unsaving or deleting items on the saved list page
